# installation
- open your alfred app
- you must have the pro version installed
- double click the  logtivly.alfredworkflow file
- should be installed

# usage
- this will only work on the spreadsheet here for now: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tRziPgOwgPBCYIQZuwa7Me1vk5_tfsAWb3mcpPICxEI/edit#gid=645587249
- launch your alfred
- type `log %project% %hours%`
- ie log misc 10
- it will think for a while then it will udpate the sheet with the hours you inputted on the project on the same day

# assumptions
- a column already exists for the same day you're posting this
- when you're typing a project, the project exists.. although the search is case insensitive and covers all elements of the word
